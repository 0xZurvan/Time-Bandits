# Time Bandits concept

NFTs with 5 morph states. Those NFTs morph based on how much time (ERC20 token) they holds. To make it more fun, we add what we call the fate machine, which consists of a "random algorithm", that chooses a token ID after it is run, and this selected token gets frozen in wherever morph state it is.
